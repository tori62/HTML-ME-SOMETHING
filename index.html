            <p>Tori Gonzalez was born in 1962 in Atlanta, Georgia and
            moved to Birmingham, Alabama at the age of 4.  Both her 
            parents are Mexican width spanish as their first language. Raised
            in Birmingham, Alabama, Tori witnessed the racial divide of the 
            60's.  After fifty years, she continues to struggle to put it all 
            in perspective!
